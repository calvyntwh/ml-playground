# ML Playground 🚀

A modern, Docker-based Python 3.13 machine learning environment-optimized for Apple Silicon (M1/M2), ready for JupyterLab, and fully integrated with VS Code Dev Containers.

---

## ✨ Features

- **Python 3.13 (slim, ARM64/AMD64)** - Fast, modern, and compatible with all major ML libraries.
- **Blazing-fast installs** with [uv](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv).
- **Pre-installed ML/data science stack:** NumPy, pandas, scikit-learn, TensorFlow, PyTorch, matplotlib, seaborn, tqdm, and JupyterLab.
- **JupyterLab** for interactive notebooks.
- **VS Code Dev Container** support for seamless, reproducible development.
- **Persistent storage** for notebooks, scripts, and data-versioned with Git.

---

## 🚀 Quick Start

### 1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/ml-playground.git
cd ml-playground
```

### 2. Build the Docker image

```bash
docker build -t ml-playground .
```

### 3. Run the container

```bash
docker run --rm -p 8888:8888 \
  -v $(pwd)/notebooks:/app/notebooks \
  -v $(pwd)/data:/app/data \
  -v $(pwd)/scripts:/app/scripts \
  ml-playground
```

- Open the JupyterLab URL from your terminal (usually `http://localhost:8888`).

## 📝 Tips & Best Practices

- **All your work is persistent:** Notebooks, scripts, and data are stored on your Mac and versioned with Git.
- **Update dependencies:** Edit `requirements.txt` and rebuild the Docker image as needed.
- **For new packages:** Install them in `requirements.txt` for reproducibility.
- **For Apple Silicon:** This setup is optimized for ARM64, but works on Intel Macs too.

---

## 🛠️ Troubleshooting

- **Build errors?**  
  Ensure you have a recent version of Docker Desktop and enough memory allocated.
- **ML library issues?**  
  Use the latest versions of TensorFlow and PyTorch for best ARM64 support.
- **Jupyter not accessible?**  
  Make sure you’re mapping port 8888 and using the correct URL from the terminal.
